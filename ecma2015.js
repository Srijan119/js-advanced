// Async/await is a syntactic sugar on top of promises.
//  It provides a more concise way to write asynchronous code, making it easier to read and write.
//  With Async/Await, you can write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code, and it uses promises under the hood.

// In async/await, the async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function.
//  The await keyword is used to wait for a promise to be resolved before continuing with the execution of the function.
//   The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.


// A promise is an object that eventually leads to an asynchronous operationâ€™s completion or failure. 
// A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
//  When the asynchronous operation is completed, the Promise will either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with an error.





 //The only difference is the execution context between promise and async/await.

// When a Promise is created and the asynchronous operation is started, the code after the Promise creation continues to execute synchronously.
//  When the Promise is resolved or rejected, the attached callback function is added to the microtask queue. 
// The microtask queue is processed after the current task has been completed but before the next task is processed from the task queue. 
// This means that any code that follows the creation of the Promise will execute before the callback function attached to the Promise is executed.

// On the other hand, with Async/Await, the await keyword causes the JavaScript engine to pause the execution of the async function until the Promise is resolved or rejected. 
// While the async function waits for the Promise to resolve, it does not block the call stack, and any other synchronous code can be executed. 
// Once the Promise is resolved, the execution of the async function resumes, and the result of the Promise is returned. If rejected, it throws an error value.
